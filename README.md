<h1>PLANETS</h1>
<h4>Because planets <i>totally</i> move the same way Asteroids do.</h4>
<hr>

<p>Planets is a clone of the ever popular, classic game Asteroids. Of course, it is not the fully fledged game itself, but an imitation. (For example, the scoring system is much simpler - it's only based on how many hits you make.) Fun, nevertheless, I hope. </p>

<p>This project was meant as Javascript practice - specifically with canvas.js. Even so, there are certain features I am happy about - and some I have made peace with. <p>

<h5>Satisfied:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>White on Black contrast in interface</li>
	<li>Evident ship rotation</li>
	<li>Limitation of ship's max speed. (Seriously, the thing could go so fast, it would become a steady beam of light on the screen.)</li>
	<li>Randomised but handle-able planets</li>
</ul>

<h5>Made peace with:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Planets, not asteroids. Could get the asteroids to look like asteroids, but not collision</li>
	<li>Not <b>true</b> collision detection.
		<ul>
			<li>Detection determined on basis of radius from center</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Limited bullets per shot </li>

<p>Feel like trying it out? Of course you do! </p>
